# CSCI6364 Machine Learning 
This is a group for hosting repositories for labs and the final project for Patrick and Matt's team. 
Professor Qu is here too :) 

There is a folder called 'scratch_notebooks' for running tests in jupyter notebooks, which can be ran over your browser using GitHub codespaces (basically running VS code in your browser)
